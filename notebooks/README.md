- **[Eliott] food_keywords.ipynb** : Short notebook to investigate the distribution of Agribalyse ingredients in the different categories ("Groupe') and subcategories ("Sous-groupe")
- **[Eliott] recipes_footprints.ipynb** : Notebook to match Jow ingredients with Agribalyse ingredients and store the carbon footprint
- **[Genevieve] ingredients_scores__explore.ipynb** : Exploratory notebook to get familiarized with JOW/Agribalyse databases and see how to match them
- **[Genevieve] ingredients_scores__process** : notebook which generates the output file "Jow_Agribalyse_ingredients_scores.xlsx" giving the list of Jow ingredients together with their corresponding Agribalyse ingredients and mean environmental scores
- **[Genevieve]find_closest_recipe_from_menu_by_hand** : notebook which generates the output files "MenuToJowRecipes_v1.xlsx", ... Each menu recipe is associated by hand with one (or several) matching recipes in JOW database.
- **[Genevieve]NLP_explore.ipynb** : Exploratory notebook to investigate how BERT NLP methods can be used to match menu recipes (from "MenuToJowRecipes_v1.xlsx") to JOW recipes. The different models are evaluated and compared knowing for each menu recipe the matching recipe(s) in JOW found by hand and stored in "MenuToJowRecipes_v1.xlsx".
